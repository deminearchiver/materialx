### Theory behind MCU

Color is a powerful design tool and part of the Material system along with
styles like typography and shape. In products, colors and the way they are used
can be vast and varied. An app’s color scheme can express brand and style.
Semantic colors can communicate meaning. And color contrast control supports
visual accessibility.

In many design systems of the past, designers manually picked app colors to
support the necessary range of color applications and use cases. Material 3
introduces a dynamic color system, which does not rely on hand-picked colors.
Instead, it uses color algorithms to generate beautiful, accessible color
schemes based on dynamic inputs like a user’s wallpaper. This enables greater
flexibility, personalization, and expression, all while streamlining work for
designers and teams.

Material Color Ultilities (MCU) powers dynamic color with a set of color
libraries containing algorithms and utilities that make it easier for you to
develop color themes and schemes in your app.

The library consists of various components, each having its own folder and
tests, designed to be as self-contained as possible. This enables seamless
integration of subsets into other libraries, like Material Design Components
and Android System UI. Some consumers do not require all components, for
example, MDC doesn’t need quantization, scoring, image extraction.
